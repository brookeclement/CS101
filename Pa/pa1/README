Notes to Grader
    1. List.java
        List.java creates a List module with the exact specifications from the Pa1 document.

    2. ListClient.java
        ListClient.java is a test client provided by P. Tantalo for the purposes of testing
        our ListADT module.

    3. Lex.java
        Lex.java is a client of List.java and uses List.java services to sort an input file in
        alphabetical order. First the user gives a command line argument corresponding to a text
        file. Then, Lex.java reads the input file, stores the input file as one string, then copies
        each line into and index in a string array. Once the string array is obtained, Lex.java
        uses the List Object from List.java to indirectly sort the string array, by sorting is indicies.
        I based the sorting algorithm for Lex.java on InsertionSort(). Finally Lex.java prints
        the sorted output to the file specified by the second command line argument, which was
        also provide by the user.

    4. Makefile
        The Makefile for pa1 was given by P. Tantalo, and is unaltered from its original form.
