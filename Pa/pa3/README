Notes to Grader
    1. Sparse.java is a MatrixADT client that takes two command line arguments from the user.
    The first command line argument is reference to a formatted text file that gives information
    about two sparse matrices. Sparse then creates these two matrices, and performs some basic
    Matrix arithmetic on the two matrices, prints the results to the output file as specified
    by the second command line argument, given by the user.

    2. Matrix.java is a MatrixADT created to exploit the properties of sparse matrices. It does
    so by using an array of List Entry objects, who hold the value of non zero entries in the
    matrix.

    3. List.java is a ListADT of Node objects, where each Node has a data field of type Object.
    The List is indexed and contains a cursor feature to get data from the data field.

    4. MatrixTest.java is a MatrixADT test client used to test the proper functionality of the
    MatrixADT. Simply uncomment blocks of code to verify the given operations work as specified.

    5. ListTest.java is a ListADT test client used to test the Object functionality of the
    Node.data field of the List.

    6. The makefile used was given by P Tantalo for purposes of pa3.
